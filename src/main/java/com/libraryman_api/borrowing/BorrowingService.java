/**
 * Service class for managing the borrowing and returning of books in the LibraryMan system.

 * <p>This service handles the borrowing and returning processes, including calculating
 * due dates, imposing fines for overdue returns, and managing the availability of books.
 * It also integrates with the {@link NotificationService} to send notifications
 * related to borrowing, returning, and fines.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each method interacts with the {@link BorrowingRepository} and {@link FineRepository}
 * to perform database operations, ensuring consistency and proper transactional behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p>In cases where a book or borrowing record is not found, or if an operation cannot be completed
 * (e.g., returning a book with an outstanding fine), the service throws a
 * {@link ResourceNotFoundException}.</p>
